#### Introduction 
<p> TARS-The very lovable, chatty, and 70% sarcastic robot. For those of you who don't follow the reference, I suggest you go to this link and learn what this Robot from the movie Interstellar was. </p>
We have been shown that TARS was an entity with a near Human sense of Emotional bandwidth and at the very least, higher than average Intelligence as compared to us humans :). Is that possible in the near future? Or can it simply be shrugged off as a relentless dream being pursued by the likes of Issac Asimov and the Christopher Nolan? 
Why don't we look at a Human body? It is just a mass amalgamation of complex chemical reactions at the very root of our being.
