### If you're here, you probably searched something related to Natural Language Processing, or maybe you're just an Interstellar fan. Well, in the latter case, I have some bad news for you. But hey, don't be disheartened, read on will ya?

We have been shown that TARS was an entity with a near Human sense of Emotional bandwidth and at the very least, higher than average Intelligence as compared to us humans :). Is that possible in the near future? Or can it simply be shrugged off as a relentless dream being pursued by the likes of [Issac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) and [Christopher Nolan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan)? 

Why don't we look at a Human body? It is just a mass amalgamation of complex chemical reactions at the very root of our being.
